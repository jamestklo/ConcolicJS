\subsection{Implementation \& Setup}

\header{Components}
Proxy: WebScarab, Java
Abstract Syntax Tree: Google Closure compiler
Backward Slicing: JavaScript library, analyze execution tree
DOM Solver: extended version of SMT (CVC3), Java API to translate SMT output into XML.
Selenium: runs on multiple browsers, including headless browsers such as PhantomJS.
QUnit:  \tool is designed to be easily extensible to other testing frameworks including Jasmine and Mocha.

\header{Indexing Functions.}
% tinysort() as example, most of the existing frameworks for unit testing don't address this issue [phantomJS].
% drives the need for extracting functions
% Go to Implementation
% gives AST ID rather than function names, because it's common for functions to share the same name, or more commonly, to be anyonmous or have no name at all  (function () {});

\header{eval(), inline and native code.}
% code inlined within HTML
% Tudu
% Go to Implementation
