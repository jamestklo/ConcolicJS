\section{Future Work \& Conclusion}
We presented a generic, transparent and cross browser approach to covering JavaScript code that contain DOM operations.  
Our approach works in the JavaScript layer and supports the Document Object Model API defined by W3C the World Wide Web Consortium.  
In the future we would like to extend our solver to support multiple data types (mostly integers and strings} so that \tool can cover more branches and paths.
