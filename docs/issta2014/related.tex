Whether the test inputs are manually, randomly (e.g. ~\cite{artemis}) or symbolically (e.g. ~\cite{kudzu, jalangi}) defined.

%\header{Emmet or Zen coding.}
%Emmet (formerly Zen coding) \cite{ZenSjeiti, ZenCoding} generates DOM elements as output.  
%Input to Emmet is the abbreviation of a CSS query that precisely specifies the DOM structure in a declarative manner.
%A major difference is that \tool solves for complex logic constraints (e.g. AND, OR conditions).


\header{Concolic Execution}
Concolic execution ~\cite{cute}, also known as dynamic symbolic execution, is a method of exhaustively executing the source code for maximizing path coverage. 
A path is a sequential permutation of branches.  For example, each IF statement has 2 branches: True and False; each iteration within a loop also has 2 branches: Stay and Break. 
Execution of branches is mutually exclusive: going to True implies not going to False.
Having the constraints generated from a dynamic backward slice, concolic execution uses a constraint solver to generate input that would drive the execution of each condition towards a specific branch. 

Kudzu ~\cite{kudzu} uses a constraint solver to conduct constraint-based testing for JavaScript Web applications. 
While our work focuses on generating HTML input to achieve path coverage, Kudzu focuses on generating string input to detect security vulnerabilities in JavaScript applications. 
Our work is also designed to run on multiple browsers, while Kudzu runs on only the browser that supports its backward slicing component [11].
%jalangi and Kudzu focuses on generating inputs, and did not address the problems of closures and making test cases runnable.
