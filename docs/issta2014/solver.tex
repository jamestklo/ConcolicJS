\section{DOM Solver}
The DOM solver takes the constraints defined by the MapDeducer and attempts to generate a satisfiable HTML.  The solver is implemented as an extension of a SMT solver~\cite{cvc3} and would report anything not satisfiable.  

\header{Boolean Functions for DOM Operations.}
A major part of the DOM is its tree structure.  In JavaScript, the tree is inferred by the DOM operations executed.  
Each DOM operation in any line of code (e.g. different conditions) is like a piece of a puzzle describing a subset clue of the overall DOM tree.

  // Interdependent logical constraints
  if (d === a.firstElementChild // i)
   || d === b.lastElementChild) {}
  if (d === a.parentElement // ii)
   || d === b.parentElement) {}
  
  if (b.previousElementSibling === 
      c.firstElementChild) {}
  
  if (a.parentElement.parentElement ===
      b.firstElementChild.nextElementSibling) {}
	  
  if (c.children[2] === a.nextElementSibling) {}  
}

Because CVC does not support strings natively, for now we map tag names into integers in CVC.  
<span> is the default tag type because <span> is an inline element and not a block.
