\section{Introduction}
% make it shorter of why JavaScript is important.  
JavaScript is increasingly a popular language for software implementation: %; and the World Wide Web is increasingly an attractive platform for delivering applications.
For end users, HTML5 and its standardization enable Web apps to have an interactivity and feature-richness comparable to those implemented for traditional desktops.  
The latest round of browser wars makes executing JavaScript more efficient, robust, secure and consistent.  
For programmers, JavaScript is relatively easy to adopt, and JavaScript does not have the burden of memory management and static typing.
More operating systems in both the desktop~\cite{chromeApps, windows8javascript} and mobile~\cite{apacheCordova, iosWebView, blackberryWebWorks, firefoxOS, androidWebView, tizen} actually now support installing and running JavaScript apps on the OS similar to native apps.
CSS3 and the responsive UI paradigm enable UI designers to use a single HTML and still support multiple devices of different screen sizes.  
The Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) movement in Enterprise IT increases hardware heterogeneity, 
which also makes JavaScript apps\footnote{JavaScript apps are preferred in Web browsers because they are lighter weight than Java applets and they do not require installation of any proprietary plugins such as Flash and Silverlight} 
a conveniently portable solution for delivering the application front end (e.g.~\cite{BNSFoffice365}).
Emergence and scalability of Node.js also make JavaScript widely adopted on the server side.  
Consequently, many institutions such as the Khan Academy~\cite{khanAcademy} use JavaScript for teaching programming; and JavaScript has consistently been a top 2 in the RedMonk~\cite{redmonk} popularity rankings.%~\footnote{results are based on projects hosted at GitHub and questions asked at StackOverflow}.

Yet, despite the language's promise and ubiquity, testing JavaScript is not easy.  
For example, because HTML describes the graphical user interface of a Web app, considerable JavaScript code is written to access and mutate HTML through the Document Object Model (DOM) API.  
When JavaScript code runs, its runtime execution would encounter operations on the DOM API (DOM operations) that would subtly imply the DOM tree (and thus the webpage's HTML) to have a particular structure.  
In other words, when trying to run a test case, if the DOM structure does not satisfy what the code expects it to be, execution would fail and the test case would terminate prematurely.  
Indeed, a recent empirical study~\cite{frolin2013} of bug reports has concluded that a majority of bugs in JavaScript Web applications are DOM related.  
Being able to fully test JavaScript code that contain DOM operations would be critical in assuring the quality of a Web application.

To further illustrate the necessity of having a satisfiable DOM structure, suppose we conduct concolic unit-testing on the {\tt function checkRows()} in Sample Code \ref{dom0}.  
The function is simplified from a feature Chrome Experiment~\cite{domtris} that uses the DOM to implement the game Tetris.

%The function comes from a sample Web application written by Intel~\cite{mancala} for developing in the Tizen OS.

Concolic testing~\cite{cute}, also known as dynamic symbolic testing, would execute the app in a way to maximize path coverage.
A path is a sequential permutation of branches.  For example, an {\tt if} statement has at least a {\tt True} branch and a {\tt False} branch.  
A loop has 2 branches, {\tt Stay} and {\tt Break}.  The condition inside the statement or loop decides which branch the execution would follow.  
Maximizing path coverage would be to generate inputs for executing every possible permutation of condition branches.  
In the {\tt function checkRows()} in Sample Code \ref{dom0}, we must visit both the {\tt True} and {\tt False} branches of the {\tt if} statement in {\tt line 6}.

If we intend an execution path to visit the {\tt True} branch of the {\tt if} statement at {\tt line 6} of Sample Code \ref{dom0}, 
the Web application must have a DOM tree structure satisfying many constraints:
\begin {compactitem}
\item There is an element with ID {\tt "field"} ({\tt line 2}).
\item {\tt field} contains children elements, so that we can first enter the {\tt for} loop ({\tt line 4}).
\item There are rows having ID's in the nomenclature {\tt row0}, {\tt row1}, etc ({\tt line 5}).
\item The number of rows must be greater than or equal to the number of children that {\tt field} has.  The reason is that the ID of each {\tt row} is made distinct by {\tt i} ({\tt line 5}).  According to the {\tt for} loop, {\tt i---} goes from {\tt field.children.length} to 1 ({\tt line 4}).
\item At least one of the rows must have exactly 10 children ({\tt line 6}).
\end {compactitem}
}

Until all of the above constraints are satisfied, the function's execution would likely lean towards an unintended path or would even halt.
For example, when the DOM tree does not have an element with ID {\tt "field"}, the variable {\tt field} would have a {\tt null} value.
Consequently, the property access {\tt field.children} would result in a {\tt Type Error} and the rest of the function cannot be run or tested.
Thus a satisfying DOM tree must be generated so that the function's execution would not crash and would visit the specific path that we intend.  

While manual generation of DOM trees is possible, the manual approach would quickly become tedious and not scalable.  
The reason is that a unique structure of the DOM tree is required for going through a different execution path.  
For example, to go to the {\tt False} branch of the above {\tt if} statement, rows cannot have 10 children.
Therefore, to cover both the {\tt True} and {\tt False} branches of the {\tt if} statement in {\tt line 6}, we must generate 2 unique DOM trees.  
Generally for an {\tt if} statement, we have to consider generating an unique DOM tree for each of the {\tt true} branch,  all {\tt else if} branches, and the {\tt else} branch.  
Loops are more difficult for achieving path coverage, because generally it is not easy to determine what the upper limit is for iterating a loop.  
For example, {\tt field} can have any number of children in Sample Code ~\ref{dom0}.  Thus the loop can get iterated any number of times.  

%Overall, covering an additional conditional statement, be it an {\tt if}, a {\tt switch} or a loop, would potentially multiply the number of unique DOM trees.  

Nevertheless, the number of unique DOM structures would at least double whenever we try to cover an additional DOM-dependent condition, be the condition is inside an {\tt if}, a {\tt switch} or a loop.  
Moreover, manual generation can become complex as DOM-dependent conditions can get scattered across multiple files in the code, making it labor intensive to accurately trace all of the DOM elements and relevant constraints.  
Random generation is simply not desirable because the required DOM tree may have a structure too precise for a random tree to match by chance.  
Thus the desired approach has to be automated, systematic and precisely targeted.


\header{Contributions.}
The following are the main contributions of the Research Proficiency Evaluation (RPE) report:
\begin {compactitem}
\item We propose an automated, generic, transparent and browser-independent approach for systematically generating DOM tree structures to test JavaScript code that contains DOM operations.
\item We describe how JavaScript code and its execution can dynamically be analyzed for deducing constraints relevant for generating DOM trees.
\item We design a novel DOM solver to support the DOM's 2D tree structure, to infer implicit clues from DOM operations that are partial and incomplete, and to tailor the DOM tree for targeting precise subsets of the code base.
\item We present an implementation of our end to end automatic system from deducing constraints to generating HTML and driving test execution.
\item We report how \tool and its generated DOM trees can help test suites improve coverage and reach complete execution.  If a function cannot be fully executed, the test case's assertions cannot be fully run.  
\end {compactitem}

\tool augments approaches that aim to generate tests automatically.  
Random testing (e.g.~\cite{artemis}), mutation testing (e.g.~\cite{pythia}), concolic testing (e.g.~\cite{eventConcolic, feedbackConcolic, kudzu, jalangi, cute})... 
to our best knowledge, almost all of existing research on test generation focused on generating 1) function arguments for unit testing, or 2) events and UI inputs (e.g strings for text fields and forms; mouse clicks for buttons and selection boxes; and key presses) for application-level testing.  
However, having just the function arguments, events and UI inputs is often insufficient.  
For example, in a Web app, a properly satisfied dependency such as the DOM is often necessary for test cases and assertions to reach complete execution.  

Moreover, it should be noted that the {\tt function checkRows()} does not take any input arguments; and functions without input arguments are common in JavaScript.
Yet, these functions depend on major dependencies such as the DOM.
Thus even when we have a test suite that is very well defined and can potentially yield a very high coverage, whether through manual or automatic generation, 
considerable JavaScript code cannot get properly tested or covered unless the corresponding DOM structure is properly defined.  
\tool provides an automated and systematic solution for generating satisfiable DOM trees in HTML form.
